IMPORTANT: the backend is run in this folder. The frontend code can be found here: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/students-keeper-app-part-1-starting-forked-pqt7zn?file=%2Fsrc%2Fheader.jsx

GitHub: https://github.com/Sown-Dev/KeeperX (I omitted this in the presentation because its here already)

ALSO: I spent maybe 30 minutes rerecording the demo video with 2 separate microphones because all of my videos kept having the audio cut out. I've opted to simply upload the video with no audio and at a faster speed just so you can see what I demonstrate.

Code is mostly in
server.js
models/note.js
routes/notes.js

See Presentation.pdf for more details.
